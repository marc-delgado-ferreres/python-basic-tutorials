### Variables ###

# What is their function? #

# Variables are used to store and manipulate data by assigning a name to a value.

# Types of Variables #

# There are different types of variables.

# Integer Variable [int] #

# This variable can only be an integer number.

integer = 10
print(integer)
print("The result is", integer)
print("The result is {}".format(integer))
print(f"The result is {integer}")

# In this example, a variable called "integer" is created and assigned the number 10.
# Then, the "print()" function is used to display the content of the "integer" variable on the console.
# As a result, it will print "10".
# As a result, it will print "The result is 10".
# As a result, it will print "The result is 10".
# As a result, it will print "The result is 10".

# Floating-point Variable [float] #

# This variable can only be a decimal number.

floating = 9.81
print(floating)
print("The result is", floating)
print("The result is {}".format(floating))
print(f"The result is {floating}")

# In this example, a variable called "floating" is created and assigned the number 9.81.
# Then, the "print()" function is used to display the content of the "floating" variable on the console.
# As a result, it will print "9.81".
# As a result, it will print "The result is 9.81".
# As a result, it will print "The result is 9.81".
# As a result, it will print "The result is 9.81".

# String Variable [str] #

# This variable can only be a string of text.

text_string = "Gravity"
print(text_string)
print("The result is", text_string)
print("The result is {}".format(text_string))
print(f"The result is {text_string}")

# In this example, a variable called "text_string" is created and assigned the text "Gravity".
# Then, the "print()" function is used to display the content of the "text_string" variable on the console.
# As a result, it will print "Gravity".
# As a result, it will print "The result is Gravity".
# As a result, it will print "The result is Gravity".
# As a result, it will print "The result is Gravity".

# Boolean Variable [bool] #

# This variable can only be True or False.

boolean = True
print(boolean)
print("The result is", boolean)
print("The result is {}".format(boolean))
print(f"The result is {boolean}")

# In this example, a variable called "boolean" is created and assigned "True".
# Then, the "print()" function is used to display the content of the "boolean" variable on the console.
# As a result, it will print "True".
# As a result, it will print "The result is True".
# As a result, it will print "The result is True".
# As a result, it will print "The result is True".
