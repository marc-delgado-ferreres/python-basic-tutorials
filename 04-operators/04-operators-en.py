### Operators ###

# What is their function? #

# Operators are special symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.
# They allow for mathematical calculations, comparisons, and data manipulations.

# Arithmetic Operators #

# Arithmetic operations are basic mathematical operations used to perform numerical calculations.

# Addition #

addition = 75 + 25
print(addition)

# The "+" operator is used to add.
# The result is stored in the variable "addition".
# As a result, the value of "addition" will be:
# 100

addition += 100
print(addition)

# The "+=" operator is used to add a value to a variable.
# The result is stored in the variable "addition".
# As a result, the value of "addition" will be:
# 200

# Subtraction #
